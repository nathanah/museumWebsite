          Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
          Davis) retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York,
          this exhibition features the first realization of a
          participatory environment Nauman conceived in 1970. The work
          is a narrow passageway that wraps around an existing room,
          combining colored fluorescent light and closed-circuit video
          to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual experience. An adjacent
          gallery includes artworks that situate the corridor within the
          artist’s career.

          Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries
          of art since 1960 as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s -
          beginning with his time as a graduate student in the UC Davis
          studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 - Nauman
          was at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed
          process and activity over static, predetermined forms, and
          that took up language and the body as materials. Unbound by
          traditional divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely
          between sculpture, performance, film, video, photography,
          drawing, printmaking, and large-scale installation.
          <br>
          <br>
          This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective,
          co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the
          Schaulager Basel, the artist's first in over twenty
          years. While the retrospective provides an opportunity to
          survey the full breadth of Nauman's work, the present
          exhibition at the Manetti Shrem Museum focuses on a single,
          exceptional artwork: a large-scale participatory environment
          from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976, Nauman designed some
          forty corridors, rooms, and other architectural installations.
          The majority of these installations have been built for
          exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue and Yellow
          Corridor is one of a handful that have remained on paper, in
          the form of drawings by the artist. Although Nauman originally
          developed the concept for this particular work in three
          drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first
          time that the installation has actually been realized.
