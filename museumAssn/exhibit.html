        Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
        Davis) retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York,
        this exhibition features the first realization of a
        participatory environment Nauman conceived in 1970. The work
        is a narrow passageway that wraps around an existing room,
        combining colored fluorescent light and closed-circuit video
        to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual experience. An adjacent
        gallery includes artworks that situate the corridor within the
        artist’s career.

    <p>
      Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries
      of art since 1960 as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s -
      beginning with his time as a graduate student in the UC Davis
      studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 - Nauman
      was at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed
      process and activity over static, predetermined forms, and
      that took up language and the body as materials. Unbound by
      traditional divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely
      between sculpture, performance, film, video, photography,
      drawing, printmaking, and large-scale installation.

      This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective,
      co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the
      Schaulager Basel, the artist's first in over twenty
      years. While the retrospective provides an opportunity to
      survey the full breadth of Nauman's work, the present
      exhibition at the Manetti Shrem Museum focuses on a single,
      exceptional artwork: a large-scale participatory environment
      from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976, Nauman designed some
      forty corridors, rooms, and other architectural installations.
      The majority of these installations have been built for
      exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue and Yellow
      Corridor is one of a handful that have remained on paper, in
      the form of drawings by the artist. Although Nauman originally
      developed the concept for this particular work in three
      drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first
      time that the installation has actually been realized.
